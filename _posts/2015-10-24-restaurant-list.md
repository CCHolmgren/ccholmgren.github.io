![Reexguide, current version](/images/ss+2015-10-25+at+02.07.36.jpg)

[Reexguide](https://www.reexguide.com) is a new page to browse and find restaurants. The design is mostly based on AirBnB's design, but there are some other things thrown in, here and there.

I am continuously working hard to improve everything about the page. Things will get update, changed, moved or removed all the time.

The site is run by Django running on my own server. Technologies used **Python**, **Django**, **JavaScript**, **Google Maps**, **Foundation**. Reexguide tries to have a repsonsive design with Foundation 6 at it's base.
