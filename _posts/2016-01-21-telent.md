[Telent](https://github.com/CCHolmgren/telent) is one of my side projects that just exists because I wanted to try something new. It's more or less a copy of the functionality of Instagram.

In this project I will probably need to restrain myself even more than I have to do in [Reexguide](http://www.christofferholmgren.se/2015/10/24/restaurant-list.html) because there is a lot of functionality that is quite easy to implement, but I want tot avoid feature creep as much as possible.

The site is run by Django running on my own server. Technologies used **Python**, **Django**, **JavaScript**, **Google Maps**, **Foundation 6**, **S3**. Telent tries to have a repsonsive design with Foundation 6 at it's base.
